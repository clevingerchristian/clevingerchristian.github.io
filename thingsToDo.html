			<h1>
			"Where do I start?"
			</h1>
			<p>
			The beginning of your journey through the Kanto region begins with a decision that will affect the rest of your travels. You must select 
			between 3 Pokemon, each of whom have their own distinct strengths and weaknesses.
			</p>

			<img src="Images/squirtle.jpg" alt="Pokemon 2" id="pokemon2" style="width:228px;height:257px;">
			<img src="Images/charmander.jpg" alt="Pokemon 3" id="pokemon3" style="width:228px;height:257px;">
			<p>
			After you receive your first Pokemon, it is time for you to begin your journey into the region of Kanto. Be cautious during your travels, 
			hostile wild Pokemon may appear and you will have to fight them off by using your own Pokemon. Note that some of the wild Pokemon that 
			wish to engage you may be stronger then the Pokemon in your possession. In this case, it may be better to run away. If your Pokemon does 
			receive an injury during battle and you wish to heal them, just walk to the nearest city and find their Pokemon center.
			</p>
			
			<h1>
			Capture Pokemon
			</h1>
			<p>
			<img src="Images/pokeball.png" alt="Pokeball" id="pokeball" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
			During your travels, you wont be restricted to just carrying the one Pokemon. At any point in time, you may carry up to six with you. 
			To obtain more Pokemon, you will have to weaken the wild pokemon you encounter. When you feel they are susceptible, throw a pokeball
			to try and capture them. If you are unsuccessful, the Pokemon will break out of the pokeball, breaking the pokeball. But do not worry
			if you run out of pokeballs. Many cities have pokemarts, which will be able to supply your pokeball needs. Pokemarts also contain 
			potions to help your Pokemon recover from wounds while you are away from pokemon centers.
			</p>
			
			<h1>
			Battle Others
			</h1>
			<p>
			While you are traveling through the region, you may encounter others who also have Pokemon. Some of these people may wish to test their
			skills as a Pokemon trainer against you. After being challenged by a trainer, you must commit to battle, you may not run away. While battling a 
			trainer, you may only use one Pokemon. If you wish to really test your skills as a Pokemon trainer, you may want to seek out the Pokemon 
			gyms found throughout the region's cities. These Pokemon gyms contain a gym leader and his recruits, who all use the same type of Pokemon. 
			If you are successful in beating the leader of a gym, you will receive a badge. If you defeat all 8 gym leaders in Kanto, then you may 
			challenge the Elite Four. Information on the 8 gyms of Kanto can be found bellow.
