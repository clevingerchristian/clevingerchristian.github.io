			Learn the Land!
			</h1>
			<p>
			The region of Kanto has many different attributes to it. There are forests, 
			caves, beaches, and islands. Each of these environments have special people 
			and Pokemon that belong to it. When exploring the different environments, 
			it will be imperative to prepare to face any unique challenges that the area 
			may bring you. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>
			Forests
			</h2>
			<p>
			Kanto has many forested areas. The most well-known forest of Kanto would be 
			the Viridian Forest, which is located in between Viridian City and Pewter City
			on Route 2. Veridian Forest, like the other forests of the region, contain a 
			plethora of bug type Pokemon. Those traveling through the forests should be 
			cautious of the Pokemon's stinger and make sure they don't get their Pokemon 
			poisoned by the wild Pokemon found in Kanto's forests. It would be wise to carry 
			Antidotes to heal any Pokemon who may become poisoned.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
			Caves
			</h2>
			<p>
			To get to some major cities, it may be necessary to travel through a cave system.
			Some cave systems are well lit and you can see perfectly fine in them, while other 
			caves will have you struggling to see what's in front of your face. There may be 
			rocks and boulders that also imede you from continuing in the direction you would 
			like to move towards. Luckily, some Pokemon have the ability to illuminate the dim 
			lit caves, break small rocks, and even move boulders. It is recommended that anyone 
			traveling through one of the many cave systems brings a Rescue Rope with them, to 
			help them if they become lost inside.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
			On the Waters
			</h2>
			<p>
			To get to some areas within Kanto, it is necessary to traverse the waters. But be
			weary, even when surfing the waters, you are still susceptible to encounters with 
			wild Pokemon. Some trainers may be waiting in the waters so they can challenge 
			those who come in their seights.
